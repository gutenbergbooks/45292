      paces in the Park,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Harnessed in silk and led by leathern lead,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lives his dull life, and recks not of the Shark
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In distant waters. Lapped in sloth and greed,
    </p>
    <p>
      He fails in strenuous life to make a mark,

    <p>
      The placid Pug that paces in the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

      Round the slow circle of his nights and days
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His life revolves in calm monotony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not unsusceptible to casual praise,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And mildly moved by the approach of "tea,"
    </p>
    <p>
      No forked and jagged lightning leaps and plays
    </p>
    <p>
      Round the slow circle of his nights and days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He scarcely turns his round protuberant eyes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To mark the mood of animals or men.
    </p>
    <p>
      His joy is limited to mild surmise
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When a new biscuit swims into his ken.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when athwart his gaze a Rabbit flies,
    </p>
    <p>
      He scarcely turns his round protuberant eyes.

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Might well admonish him to take a rest,

      The Pug at home snores in ignoble ease.

    <p class="indent5">
      And beard the Lobster in his dangerous mood,

      Would not their lives more sane, more useful be,

    <p class="indent5">
      Untouched by thoughts of all that might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undreaming that he might have "steered his bark"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Through many a stirring sight and stormy scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      But being born a Pug and not a Shark
    </p>
    <p>
      The placid Pug still paces in the park.

      Not by design these good men work

      To raise that beast to heights contested,

      With those who procreation shirk.

      <br />
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Between man and the meanest rabbit

    <p>
      There is an evident hiatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Each year, by lowest computations,
    </p>
    <p>
      Six times the rabbit rears her young,
    </p>
    <p>
      And frequent marriages among
    </p>

      The very closest blood relations
    </p>
    <p>
      In very tender years ensure
    </p>
    <p>
      A constant stream of "little strangers,"
    </p>
    <p>
      Who, quickly grown to gallant rangers,
    </p>
    <p>
      See that their families endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

      Not theirs to shirk paternal cares,

      Moved by considerations sordid,
    </p>
    <p>
      A child can always "be afforded";
    </p>
    <p>
      The same applies to Belgian hares.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These noble brutes, pure Duty's pendants,
    </p>
    <p>
      May live to see their blood vermilion
    </p>
    <p>
      Coursing through something like a billion

      Wholly legitimate descendants.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowledge's path is hard and stony,

      And some may read who unaware are
    </p>
    <p>
      That rabbit brown and Belgian hare are
    </p>
    <p>
      Both members of the genus Coney.

      The common hare, who lives in fields

    <p>
      And never goes into a hole,
    </p>
    <p>
      (In this inferior to the mole)

    <p>
      In all things to the Belgian yields.

      He will, immoral brute, decline

      To multiply domestic "pledges,"
    </p>
    <p>
      The family he rears in hedges
    </p>
    <p>
      Is often limited to nine.
    </p>

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Such shocking want of <i>savoir faire</i>,

      (Surely a symptom of insanity)

      Might goad a Bishop to profanity
